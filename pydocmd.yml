# This tells pydocmd which pages to generate from which Python modules,
# functions and classes. At the first level is the page name, below that
# is a tree of Python member names (modules, classes, etc.) that should be
# documented. Higher indentation leads to smaller header size.
generate:
- play_const.md:
  - python_sdk.playing++   # (+ to include members)
  - python_sdk.constants+    # (+ to include members)

# MkDocs pages configuration. The `<<` operator is sugar added by pydocmd
# that allows you to use an external Markdown file (eg. your project's README)
# in the documentation. The path must be relative to current working directory.
pages:
- Home: index.md << README.md
- players: play_const.md

nav:
- Home: index.md << README.md
