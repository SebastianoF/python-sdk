# This tells pydocmd which pages to generate from which Python modules,
# functions and classes. At the first level is the page name, below that
# is a tree of Python member names (modules, classes, etc.) that should be
# documented. Higher indentation leads to smaller header size.
generate:
- entities.md:
  - python_sdk.entities++

- operations.md:
  - python_sdk.operations.Search+
  - python_sdk.operations.Reference+
- cargo_movements.md:
  - python_sdk.movements++

# MkDocs pages configuration. The `<<` operator is sugar added by pydocmd
# that allows you to use an external Markdown file (eg. your project's README)
# in the documentation. The path must be relative to current working directory.
pages:
- Home: index.md << README.md
- Entities: entities.md
- Operations: operations.md
- Cargo Movements: cargo_movements.md
